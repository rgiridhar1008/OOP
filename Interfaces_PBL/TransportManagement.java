/*1. A transport management application needs to handle different types of vehicles in a uniform way. Define an interface Vehicle 
 * with methods to start the vehicle, stop it, and get its fuel type. Implement two classes:
 

Car – represents a petrol-powered car.

ElectricBike – represents an electric bike.

In the main program, store both types of vehicles in an array of Vehicle references, then iterate through 
the array to start each vehicle, display its fuel type, and stop it.*/
